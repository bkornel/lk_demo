The Lucasâ€“Kanade method assumes that the displacement of the image contents between two nearby frames is small and approximately constant within a neighborhood of the point p under consideration. Thus the optical flow equation can be assumed to hold for all pixels within a window centered at p. Namely, the local image flow vector must satisfy...
